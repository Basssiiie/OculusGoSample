# OculusGoSample
Sample Unity project for testing on the Oculus Go. I recommend downloading the full project and building it for your Go device yourself to experience it.

If you want to use some of the testing elements in the demo for your own projects, you can find a couple of Unity packages for easy installation over here: https://github.com/Basssiiie/OculusGoSample/releases
